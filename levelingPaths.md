PoE Leveling Gem Guide (by Class & Build)

Legend & General Tips:

Classes: M (Marauder), D (Duelist), T (Templar), W (Witch), S (Shadow), R (Ranger), Sc (Scion).

Act 3 Library: After completing 'A Fixture of Fate' in Act 3, Siosa sells most gems up to that point. This is a great time to fill in any missing gems.

Act 6 Lilly Roth: After clearing the Twilight Strand in Act 6, Lilly Roth will sell almost every skill gem in the game.

Socket Colors: Pay close attention to the socket colors required. Check vendors in each new town for items with the links you need.
